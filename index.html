            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The problem this project undertakes is the lack of mainstream understanding of U.S. immigration patterns over time. Since
                U.S. immigration policy has become a hot topic over the past year, most of the conversation revolved around
                the importance of the narrative that the U.S as a “nation of immigrants” and continue on a line of argumentation
                to uphold said narrative. However, there is a little discussion about the history of how immigrants came
                to the United States, a discussion on how, from where, and why immigrants came to the United States when
                they did. Also lacking from the discussion is a historical understanding of how United States legislative
                efforts have shaped and affected who came to the United States at various points in its history.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project aims to solve that by showing where immigrants have come to the United States over time from a global perspective,
                individually by country, as well as where they have settled in the United States more recently. This is done
                to get a larger historical perspective, a global perspective as to where immigrants are coming from, and
                a more recent perspective of where people are settling in the United States.

            <h2>Case study: China</h2>
            <p>
                China provides an interesting use case into understanding exactly how much legsilation can effect immigration movements.
                Leading up to the 1870s you can see that there is a strong influx of immigration from China. This was due
                to the Chinese coming over to work as laborers on transcontinental railroads such as the Central Pacific
                Railroad, as well as working as miners. Chinese immigrants faced discrimination at every level and those
                that felt threatened by the presense of Chinese immigrants dubbed it the "yellow peril".

            </p>

            <p>
                Despite efforts for equal treatments many labor unions rallied against Chinese immigration leading to Page Act of 1875 aimed
                to limit Chinese immigrants and reinofrced a stigma that the Chinese are "dishonest". The Page Act also responded
                to the perceived idea that was promoted by the American Medical Association that the Chinese brought in ”germs”
                that were “deadly” to Whites. This led to the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act which prohibited any immigration
                from China and is the only law put into effect to discriminate immigration by race. It would be made permenant
                in 1902 and stay in place till 1943. There would not be large influx of Chinese immigration until Immigration
                and Nationality Act of 1965 uplifting some restrictive quotas on the amount of immigrants and after President
                Nixon's famous trip to China in 1972 to normalize relations with China after 25 years of seperation between
                the U.S. and China.

                     Outside of the case study you can use this tool to select a country or multiple countries to compare and see when and in
                    what numbers immigrants from the selected countries are coming to the USA. This provides a nice easy
                    way to investigate trend and a starting place to then dig into either what may have caused a dip or spike
                    in immigration from a certain country, countries, or a region. It is a good starting point to look for
                    other information in the history of immigration to the United States broken down by country.
